Basic characteristics of real estate market in Europe and Poland


# Housing price statistics - house price index

+ **The house price index**, abbreviated as HPI, is an index that measures the changes in the transaction prices of dwellings purchased by households.

+ **The HPI (Housing Price Index)** shows the price changes of residential properties purchased by households (flats, detached houses, terraced houses, etc.), both newly-built and existing ones, independently of their final use and independently of their previous owners. 

+ HPIs are computed as **Laspeyres-type** annual chain indices allowing weights to be changed each year.

+ The European Union HPIs are calculated as weighted averages of the national HPIs, currently using as weights the GDP at market prices (based on PPS) of the countries concerned.

# Housing price statistics - deflated house price index

+ **The deflated HPI** is the ratio between the nominal HPI and an index of consumer price inflation. 
+ A consumer price index, such as the HICP, or a national accounts final consumption deflator can be used for stripping out consumer prices inflation from the HPI.

# Real estate market sales in Poland -- definitions

+ **Building real estate** is a building and other facilities permanently connected with the ground, provided that they constitute separate ownership from such land under any specific provisions.
+ **Land real estate** is land with any component parts, excluding buildings and premises, provided that they constitute separate ownership. If a land and mortgage register is kept for the land property, then the land constitutes separate real estate from any other real estate held by the same owner.
+ **Premises** (an independent residential apartment or premises designated for other purposes) refers to a room or set of rooms separated with durable walls within the building dedicated to the permanent stay of persons, which together with the auxiliary rooms serve the purpose of fulfilling their housing needs or which are used according to their dedication for the purposes other than residential ones.

# EU-SILC -- basic information

+ The EU statistics on income and living conditions, abbreviated as EU-SILC,
+ EU-SILC provides two types of annual data:
    + cross-sectional data pertaining to a given time or a certain time period with variables on income, poverty, social exclusion and other living conditions;
    + longitudinal data pertaining to individual-level changes over time, observed periodically over a four-year period.
+ EU-SILC is a multi-purpose instrument which focuses mainly on income,
+ EU-SILC is based on the idea of a common “framework” and no longer a common “survey”. The common framework defines:
    + the harmonised lists of target primary (annual) and secondary (every four years or less frequently) variables to be transmitted to Eurostat;
    + common guidelines and procedures;
    + common concepts (household and income) and classifications aimed at maximising comparability of the information produced.
+ **The reference population** in EU-SILC includes all private households and their current members residing in the territory of the countries at the time of data collection. All household members are surveyed, but only those aged 16 and more are interviewed.

# EU-SILC -- basic information

+ EU-SILC is a non-obligatory, representative questionnaire survey of individual households, carried out by the face-to-face interview technique,
+ For individual interviews **a proxy interview** is allowed with another household member,
+ The information concerning the household as a whole is recorded in the household and the individual questionnaire.

# EU-SILC -- in Poland

+ A two-stage sampling scheme with different selection probabilities at the first stage was used. Primary sampling units (PSU) were enumeration census areas.
+ At the second stage dwellings were selected. 
+ All the households from the selected dwellings were supposed to enter the survey.
+ Prior to selection, primary sampling units were stratified (the voivodships, class of locality)
+ Completeness indicators according to class of locality:
    + Poland -- **0.554**
    + Warsaw -- 0.390
    + Towns 500k+ - 1mln inhabitants -- 0.419
    + Towns 100k - 500k inhabitants -- 0.483
    + Towns 20k - 100k inhabitants -- 0.536
    + Towns less than 20k inhabitants -- 0.559
    + Rural areas -- 0.681

    + Housing allowances (pol. Dodatki Mieszkaniowe),

        + apartment in a building with 10 or more dwellings (pol. budynek z 10 i więcej lokalami mieszkalnymi)
        + other
    + Dwelling equipped with: cold running water, flush toilet, bath or shower, hot water (from the central system or heated locally), gas (from the central network or from the cylinder).

# EU-SILC -- Overcrowding rate, 2015

**The overcrowding rate** describes the proportion of people living in an overcrowded dwelling, as defined by the number of rooms available to the household, the household’s size, as well as its members’ ages and their family situation.

A person is considered as living in an overcrowded household if the household does not have at its disposal a minimum number of rooms equal to:

+ one room for the household;
+ one room per couple in the household;
+ one room for each single person aged 18 or more;
+ one room per pair of single people of the same gender between 12 and 17 years of age;
+ one room for each single person between 12 and 17 years of age and not included in the previous category;
+ one room per pair of children under 12 years of age.


**The population at risk of poverty** people living in households where equivalised disposable income per person was below 60 % of the national median.

# EU-SILC -- Severe housing deprivation, 2014 and 2015

**The severe housing deprivation rate** is defined as the proportion of persons living in a dwelling which is considered as being overcrowded, while having at the same time at least one of these aforementioned housing deprivation measures.

Housing deprivation is a measure of poor amenities and is calculated by referring to those households with a leaking roof, no bath/shower and no indoor toilet, or a dwelling considered too dark.

# EU-SILC -- Housing cost overburden rate by tenure status, 2015
